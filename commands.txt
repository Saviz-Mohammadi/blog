General guidelines:

@ Spacing in markdown:

-- Type nbsp to add a single space.
-- Type ensp to add 2 spaces.
-- Type emsp to add 4 spaces.

-- You can use non-breaking space (nbsp) 4 times to insert a tab.
   Please append & in the beginning and ; in the end of the above suggested space syntax

@ Bold

-- To make bold in markup, do this: **text**
-- In HTML do this: <b>text</b>

@ Highlight

-- To make highlight in markup, do this: `text`
-- In HTML do this: <code>text</code> (I know, it is wierd. Seems like making code highilights it, see if you can see why)

@ How to specify syntax higlighting on code blocks

-- Write the name of the language after ``` >> ```C++

@ How to enable and disbale lines on the side of code snipites

-- Write this on the exact line after ```C++ >> ```C++ {linenos=false}
